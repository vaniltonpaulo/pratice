#AssertSubset vs AssertChoice

#AssertSubset:
  
#   This function is used to check if all elements of one vector (x) are contained in another vector (choices).
# It is appropriate for ensuring that a set of values is within a defined allowable set.
#Use this when validating multiple values or ensuring that subsets adhere to the permissible set.

# Example:


assertSubset(c("apple", "banana"), c("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
# Passes since both "apple" and "banana" are in the set of choices

#AssertChoice:
  
#   This function is used to check if a single value is part of a predefined set of allowed values (choices).
# It is more specific than assertSubset, designed for scalar values.
# Example:
assertChoice("apple", c("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
# Passes since "apple" is in the set of choices

#When to Use Each:

## - Use assertSubset when the input could have multiple elements, and you want to ensure all of them are valid options.

## - Use assertChoice when validating a single input value.



# Logical Assertions
# 
# assert_flag(x): Asserts that x is a logical scalar (TRUE or FALSE).
# assert_logical(x, len = 1): Asserts that x is a logical scalar of length 1 (TRUE, FALSE, or NA).


# Numeric Assertions
# 
# assert_number(x): Asserts that x is a numeric scalar (finite and non-NA).
# assert_int(x): Asserts that x is an integer scalar (whole number).
# assert_integerish(x, len = 1): Asserts that x can be coerced to an integer scalar.
# assert_numeric(x, len = 1): Asserts that x is a numeric scalar (supports NA and non-finite values if specified).
# assert_count(x): Asserts that x is a non-negative integer scalar (e.g., for counts).
# assert_posixct(x, len = 1): Asserts that x is a POSIXct date-time scalar.



# Character Assertions
# 
# assert_string(x): Asserts that x is a non-empty character scalar (string).
# assert_character(x, len = 1): Asserts that x is a character scalar (string) of length 1.
# assert_scalar(x): A generic assertion that x has length 1.



# Value-specific Assertions
# 
# assert_true(x): Asserts that x is TRUE.
# assert_false(x): Asserts that x is FALSE.

# ESSENTIALLY AS INPUT, WE ARE ONLY GOING TO ACCEPT(use this for for words, not in matrix rather)
# assert_choice(x, choices): Asserts that x is a scalar and one of the provided choices.

# assert_scalar_na(x): Asserts that x is a scalar NA.
# assert_scalar_non_na(x): Asserts that x is a non-NA scalar.



# Range and Bound Constraints
# 
# assert_number(x, lower = , upper = ): Asserts that x is a numeric scalar within specific bounds.
# assert_int(x, lower = , upper = ): Asserts that x is an integer scalar within specific bounds.
